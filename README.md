# zhuyin_input_trainer

**zhuyin_input_trainer** is a learning tool for Chinese Zhuyin (Bopomofo). This tool is designed to help people, especially those who already acquired a certain level in Chinese language through Pinyin, learn Zhuyin through interactive typing practices.

## Current State
The current state of **zhuyin_input_trainer** already has the essential functions needed for a zhuyin learning tool. There are now nine practices in total, carefully selected from the timeless works of two best poets, Wang Wei (王維) from the Tang dynasty and Wang Guowei (王國維) from the Qing dynasty.

## Potential Future Changes
There will be more practices added in the future. 

A custom practice importing tool might also be added in the future, which would enable user to create their own practices.
